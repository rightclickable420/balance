## 📈 Reading the Metrics

**Trades**: How many positions opened
- High = active trading
- Low = selective

**Filtered**: Prevented trades
- High = working well!
- Low = not enough filtering

**Fees**: Total cost
- Keep < 20% of balance
- Compare to Realized PnL

**Saved %**: Efficiency
- 60-80% = excellent
- 40-60% = good
- <40% = too loose

---

## 🚨 Red Flags

Switch strategies if you see:

1. **Fees > 30% of balance** → Go to High Conviction
2. **Filtered > 90%** → Go to Aggressive
3. **Win rate < 40%** → Stop and analyze
4. **Losses > 50% of deposit** → Use stop loss

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with Balanced** - Works 90% of the time
2. **Watch the metrics** - Adjust if not performing
3. **Don't chase losses** - Take breaks
4. **Use lower leverage** - If you're new
5. **Test in Mock first** - Before risking real SOL
